Demo application for handling credit card payments with AngularJS. This project is a work-in-progress that I'll continue to build as time permits. If you have any questions about a particular part of the codebase, general design decisions, or how to replicate these patterns in your application, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bendrucker/angular-payment/issues/new) and provide as much detail as possible.
